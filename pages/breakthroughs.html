                            Depression
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            As stated by Curley (2018) researchers are on a fast track to developing a treatment for
                            depression
                            using the psychedelic compound psilocybin. That means an accelerated research and approval
                            process
                            for a drug with strong preliminary evidence showing it would be a substantial improvement
                            over
                            currently
                            available therapies. The author mentions that brain scans found reduced blood flow to areas
                            of the
                            brain associated with emotional processing as well as stress and fear. There was also more
                            stability
                            in a
                            part of the brain associated with depression.

                            Addiction
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            On the report of a study by Johnson et al (2016) in the context of a structured treatment
                            program,
                            psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. Likewise,
                            the
                            authors
                            proposed that psilocybin also has potential to treat other substance use disorders,
                            including
                            alcohol
                            and cocaine addiction. The general idea is that psilocybin in well-orchestrated sessions
                            could
                            essentially shake someone out of their routine to give a glimpse of a larger picture and
                            create a
                            mental
                            plasticity with which people can step outside of those problems.

                            Anxiety
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            According to a study by Vargas et al (2020) patients with a potentially life-threatening
                            disease
                            often
                            experience considerable anxiety and psychological distress, depression, anger, loss of
                            perceived
                            self-worth, social isolation, hopelessness, and helplessness. After psilocybin
                            administration,
                            patients
                            report alleviation from anxiety, reconciliation with death,
                            spiritual
                            or religious phenomena, reconnection to life and greater confidence. The authors state that
                            psilocybin is, therefore, responsible for inducing a profound shift in consciousness,
                            enhanced ability for introspection, and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced
                            emotional processes.
