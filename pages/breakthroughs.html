                <p>
                    As stated by Curley (2018) researchers are on a fast track to developing a treatment for depression
                    using the psychedelic compound psilocybin. That means an accelerated research and approval process
                    for a drug with strong preliminary evidence showing it would be a substantial improvement over
                    currently
                    available therapies. The author mentions that brain scans found reduced blood flow to areas of the
                    brain associated with emotional processing as well as stress and fear. There was also more stability
                    in a
                    part of the brain associated with depression.

                    Addiction
                </h2>
                <p>
                    On the report of a study by Johnson et al (2016) in the context of a structured treatment program,
                    psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. Likewise, the
                    authors
                    proposed that psilocybin also has potential to treat other substance use disorders, including
                    alcohol
                    and cocaine addiction. The general idea is that psilocybin in well-orchestrated sessions could
                    essentially shake someone out of their routine to give a glimpse of a larger picture and create a
                    mental
                    plasticity with which people can step outside of those problems.

                    Anxiety
                </h2>
                <p>
                    According to a study by Vargas et al (2020) patients with a potentially life-threatening disease
                    often
                    experience considerable anxiety and psychological distress, depression, anger, loss of perceived
                    self-worth, social isolation, hopelessness, and helplessness. After psilocybin administration,
                    patients
                    report alleviation from anxiety, reconciliation with death,
                    spiritual
                    or religious phenomena, reconnection to life and greater confidence. The authors state that
                    psilocybin is, therefore, responsible for inducing a profound shift in consciousness, enhanced ability for introspection,                    and activation of vivid memory traces with pronounced emotional processes.
